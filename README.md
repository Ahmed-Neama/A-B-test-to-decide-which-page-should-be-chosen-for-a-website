# A-B-test-to-decide-which-page-should-be-chosen-for-a-website
Performing A/B test to decide whether a new page should be used instead of an old one or not.
This an application of hypothesis testing using python.
I have done this project for the advanced data analysis track by Udacity and EGFWD.
A Jupiter notebook is attached with the analysis alongside with the data files.
I am open to any recommendations!
